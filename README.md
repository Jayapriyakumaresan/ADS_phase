# Future Sales Prediction in Data Science:
 # ADS  related to Project Submission:
Source code :https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshkumar19/advertising-sales-dataset (reference kaggle.com)
This repository contains the code for predicting future sales using data science techniques. The project aims to forecast sales for a given period based on historical sales data.
# Required Python libraries: 
1.pandas,
2.numpy, 
3.scikit-learn,
# matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using the following command:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine:
# git clone https://github.com/Jayapriyakumaresan/ADS_phase/future-sales-prediction.git
cd future-sales-prediction
Run the main.py script to execute the prediction model:
  python main.py
The script will process the data, train the model, and output the predicted sales for the specified period.
# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
  data/: Contains the input data files.
  src/: Contains the source code files.
  data_processing.py: Handles data preprocessing tasks.
  model.py: Defines the machine learning model for sales prediction.
  main.py: Main script to run the prediction model.
# requirements.txt:  Python libraries required for the project.
# Customization
   You can customize the prediction model, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters in the model.py file. Additionally, you can modify the data preprocessing steps in the data_processing.py file to better suit your dataset.
# Dataset Source:
The dataset used for predicting future sales is sourced from a retail company's internal sales database. The company has collected sales data over the past several years, including various factors that can influence sales, such as product information, store location, historical sales figures, promotions, and seasonal trends.
# Dataset Description:
The dataset consists of structured data containing multiple attributes, each providing valuable insights into the sales patterns and trends. Here's a brief description of the key attributes in the dataset:
# Date:
   The date of the sales record, allowing the analysis of sales trends over time, including daily, monthly, and yearly patterns.
# Product ID:
   A unique identifier for each product sold in the store.
# Store ID:
   A unique identifier for each store where products are sold. It includes information about the store's location, size, and other relevant details.
# Sales Quantity:
  The number of units of a particular product sold on a specific date in a specific store.
# Product Category:
  The category to which the product belongs (e.g., electronics, clothing, home appliances).
# sales price:
  The selling price of the product in the respective store.
# Promotional Activities:
  Information about any promotions or discounts offered on the products, indicating whether a particular sale was part of a promotional campaign.
# Seasonal Factors:
  Indicators of seasonal influences, such as holidays, festivals, and special events, affecting consumer behavior and purchasing patterns.
# Historical Sales Data:
  Previous sales data for each product, enabling the analysis of growth or decline in sales over time.
# Results
   After running the main.py script, the predicted sales results will be stored in an output file or displayed in the console, depending on the implementation.
