# Future Sales Prediction in Data Science:
Refrence :https://www.kaggle.com/code/harshkumar19/advertising-sales-dataset
This repository contains the code for predicting future sales using data science techniques. The project aims to forecast sales for a given period based on historical sales data.
# Required Python libraries: 
1.pandas,
2.numpy, 
3.scikit-learn,
# matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using the following command:
 pip install -r requirements.txt
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository to your local machine:
# git clone https://github.com/Jayapriyakumaresan/ADS_phase/future-sales-prediction.git
cd future-sales-prediction
Run the main.py script to execute the prediction model:
  python main.py
The script will process the data, train the model, and output the predicted sales for the specified period.
# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
data/: Contains the input data files.
src/: Contains the source code files.
data_processing.py: Handles data preprocessing tasks.
model.py: Defines the machine learning model for sales prediction.
main.py: Main script to run the prediction model.
# requirements.txt: Lists the Python libraries required for the project.
# Customization
   You can customize the prediction model, feature engineering techniques, and hyperparameters in the model.py file. Additionally, you can modify the data preprocessing steps in the data_processing.py file to better suit your dataset.
# Results
   After running the main.py script, the predicted sales results will be stored in an output file or displayed in the console, depending on the implementation. 
# Dataset:
   The dataset used in this project is sourced from [provide_dataset_source_here]. Unfortunately, due to data privacy concerns, we are unable to provide the actual dataset within this repository. However, you can use any similar sales dataset in CSV format with the following columns:
# Data set:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/future-sales-prediction
  Tv_id: Unique identifier for each item.
  Newspaper_id: Unique identifier for each shop.
  Radio_id: Unique identifier for each item category.
  Sales_price: Price of the item.
  Sales_cnt_day: Number of items sold on that day.
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required Python libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and any other dependencies specified in the requirements.txt file.
